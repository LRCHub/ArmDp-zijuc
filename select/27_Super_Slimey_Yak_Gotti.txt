Yeah
That's that shit that get you dipped,
That's that shit that get you flipped
(Jimmy)
And I spit the clip
That's that shit that get you hit, that's that shit that get you [?]

Slimy, super slimy, we might slither on your block
Shooting then I'm sipping 'cause it's Wocky in my cup
Blame it on me toxic, she the reason for the faults
5 News, nigga, you can blame it on box
Iron, keep it with me, I be slanging on the opps
[?] steady banging, yeah, I'm banging on the block
Playing both sides, that's that shit that get you popped
Down bad low, nigga screaming fuck the law

One off in the head, nigga, I ain't gotta call
Head while I'm driving, nigga, I just crashed the car
Fried, I feel like Smokey, think that it's some angel dust
Told you they ain't want no smoke, why the fuck they playing with us?
Whole gang broke, tell them niggas earn it up
Can't stand in my section, nigga, you can't stand with us
He wanna be down, he told her that he ran with us
Boy, you is a clown, you know you not been riding with us
Say you stepping, step it up
Buck shots right back in the buck
That's what happens when you buck
You should've just gave it up
Since I turned up, I been having my way, I ain't letting up
Went baguette spaghetti on my neck, my ear got hockey pucks

Slimy, super slimy, we might slither on your block
Shooting then I'm sipping 'cause it's Wocky in my cup
Blame it on me toxic, she the reason for the faults
5 News, nigga, you can blame it on box
Iron, keep it with me, I be slanging on the opps
[?] steady banging, yeah, I'm banging on the block
Playing both sides, that's that shit that get you popped
Down bad low, nigga screaming fuck the law

Thirteen when I ran in front the cops, nigga
Thought it's sweet until I slid up on your block, nigga
Think I'm missing then you better have God with you
Fear of Gods, nigga, big like godzilla
You is soft like a pillow, you like marshmellow
How you hard? You ain't never had no heart, nigga
Put you together then I rip you back to parts, nigga
Born taker, really I used to just rob niggas

Slimy, super slimy, we might slither on your block
Shooting then I'm sipping 'cause it's Wocky in my cup
Blame it on me toxic, she the reason for the faults
5 News, nigga, you can blame it on box
Iron, keep it with me, I be slanging on the opps
[?] steady banging, yeah, I'm banging on the block
Playing both sides, that's that shit that get you popped
Down bad low, nigga screaming fuck the law
