There's smart new art to robbin' on the highway
That's hackin' up the banks
An' a shakin' up the skyways
It's a new ambition
It's a brand new craze
And I have to tell you boys
That supercrime pays

Well baby's got the heroin hidden in her cashmere
She's flyin' on a Tristar from Hollywood to Kashmir
She's gonna be the star of an international terror
Now she's flyin' to the stars
Cos the bomb went off in error

Chorus:
Wow, oh yeah
Shakin' in my blue suede shows
Wow, oh yeah
A wop bop a lu la bop
Dancin' to the super crook blues

Well the billionaire boys
They want a billion dollars
They're the billionaire sons of society and scholars
They're gonna join the boys of fame and wit and glory
They're gonna write a book
And they're gonna sell the story

Chorus: (x 2)

Well there's money in rape
And there's cash in terrorism
As sex crimes shown on network television,
They're laughin' in Gstaad
And they're laughin' in Marbella
Investin' in a factory and forests in Malaya
They're gonna laugh aloud
And they're gonna get away
Well I have to tell ya kids
That supercrime pays

Chorus (to end)
